# Core Concepts

MongoNext is an **opinionated** starter template designed to help you build modern, full-stack web applications quickly and with best practices. The current stack and options are intentionally focused to provide a streamlined developer experience:

- **Language:** JavaScript only (TypeScript is not yet supported)
- **Framework:** Next.js with the **App Router** (not the legacy Pages Router)
- **UI:** Material UI for all components and theming
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js

> _Note: The set of options is intentionally sparse at this time. The goal is to provide a solid, modern foundation with minimal configuration required. As the project evolves, we plan to increase flexibility and add more options based on user feedback._

This section covers the foundational ideas and architecture behind MongoNext.
