# Security Best Practices

Securing your MongoNext application is critical for protecting user data and maintaining trust. Follow these best practices for authentication, session management, and API security.

## 1. Password Hashing

- Always hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- Use a strong hashing algorithm like [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) (NextAuth.js uses bcrypt by default for credentials provider).
- Never log or expose raw passwords.

## 2. Session Handling

- Use secure, signed cookies or JWTs for session management (NextAuth.js uses JWTs by default).
- Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a strong, random value.
- Set cookies to `HttpOnly` and `Secure` (NextAuth.js does this by default in production).
- Set appropriate session expiration times.

## 3. API Security

- Protect sensitive API routes using authentication middleware (e.g., `getServerSession` or `useSession`).
- Validate all input on both client and server to prevent injection attacks.
- Use [CSRF protection](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/pages#csrf-token) for forms and API endpoints.
- Implement rate limiting on authentication and sensitive endpoints.

## 4. Environment Variables

- Never commit secrets or credentials to version control.
- Use `.env.local` for local development and set secrets in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel dashboard) for production.
- Rotate secrets regularly and update them if you suspect compromise.

## 5. General Recommendations

- Keep all dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use HTTPS in production to encrypt all traffic.
- Regularly audit user roles and permissions in your admin dashboard.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
