# Security Guidelines

Keeping your MongoNext app secure is essential for protecting user data and maintaining trust. Follow these best practices throughout development and deployment:

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Use NextAuth.js for secure authentication and session management.
- Protect admin routes and sensitive API endpoints with role-based access control.
- Never expose sensitive user data (passwords, tokens) in API responses.

## 2. Environment Variables
- Store secrets (database URIs, API keys, auth secrets) in `.env.local` and never commit them to version control.
- Set environment variables securely in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel dashboard).
- Rotate secrets regularly and update them if compromised.

## 3. Dependency Management
- Keep all dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for known issues.

## 4. HTTPS & Secure Headers
- Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt traffic.
- Set secure HTTP headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`).
- Use Vercel's built-in HTTPS and security features.

## 5. Regular Audits
- Review user roles and permissions regularly.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
- Enable audit logs in MongoDB Atlas for compliance and monitoring.
