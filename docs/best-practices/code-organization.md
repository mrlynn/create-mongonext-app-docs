# Code Organization

A well-organized codebase makes your MongoNext project easier to maintain, scale, and collaborate on. Follow these best practices for structuring your code:

## 1. Directory Structure
- Group related files by feature or domain (e.g., `products/`, `admin/`, `blog/`).
- Keep shared components in a `components/` directory.
- Place models in a `models/` directory and utilities in `lib/`.
- Use the Next.js App Router's conventions for pages and layouts.

## 2. Separation of Concerns
- Keep UI components, business logic, and data access separate.
- Use hooks for reusable logic (e.g., `useAuth`, `useProducts`).
- Place API route handlers in the `api/` directory.

## 3. Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names for files, functions, and variables.
- Use PascalCase for components and camelCase for variables/functions.
- Name files after the main export (e.g., `ProductCard.js`).

## 4. Maintainability Tips
- Keep files small and focusedâ€”split large files into smaller modules.
- Use index files (`index.js`) for cleaner imports.
- Document complex logic with comments or README files.
- Regularly refactor to improve structure as the project grows.
