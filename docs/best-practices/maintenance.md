# Maintenance Procedures

Regular maintenance keeps your MongoNext project secure, performant, and easy to work on. Follow these procedures to ensure long-term project health:

## 1. Regular Updates
- Update dependencies frequently to patch security vulnerabilities and bugs.
- Use `npm outdated` and `npm update` (or `yarn upgrade`) to check for new versions.
- Review release notes for breaking changes before upgrading major versions.

## 2. Backups & Data Safety
- Ensure MongoDB Atlas backups are enabled and tested regularly.
- Periodically test restoring from backup to verify data integrity.
- Export critical data before major upgrades or migrations.

## 3. Monitoring & Alerts
- Monitor app performance and error rates with Vercel Analytics and MongoDB Atlas monitoring.
- Set up alerts for downtime, high error rates, or unusual activity.

## 4. Documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with new features, changes, and deprecations.
- Add changelogs for each release to track updates and migrations.
- Document environment variables, scripts, and deployment steps.

## 5. Version Tracking
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., `1.2.3`) for releases.
- Tag releases in your version control system (e.g., GitHub tags).
- Communicate breaking changes clearly to users and contributors.
