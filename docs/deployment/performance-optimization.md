# Performance Optimization

Optimizing your MongoNext app ensures fast load times, efficient resource usage, and a great user experience. Here are best practices for performance at every layer.

## 1. Caching
- **API Caching:** Use HTTP caching headers (`Cache-Control`) for public API responses.
- **Client-Side Caching:** Use React Query, SWR, or similar libraries for client-side data caching.
- **Database Caching:** For heavy queries, consider in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) if needed.

## 2. CDN Configuration
- **Static Assets:** Host images, fonts, and static files on a CDN (Vercel does this automatically).
- **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js `<Image />` for automatic image resizing and optimization.
- **Edge Caching:** Leverage Vercel's edge network for global asset delivery.

## 3. Database Optimization
- **Indexes:** Add indexes to frequently queried fields (e.g., email, product/category IDs).
- **Query Optimization:** Use `.select()` to limit returned fields and `.lean()` for faster reads.
- **Pagination:** Paginate large result sets to reduce load times and memory usage.

## 4. Next.js & Material UI
- **SSR/SSG:** Use Next.js static generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR) for fast initial loads.
- **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code for each page.
- **Tree Shaking:** Import only the Material UI components you use to reduce bundle size.

## 5. Monitoring & Profiling
- **Vercel Analytics:** Monitor performance and traffic in the Vercel dashboard.
- **MongoDB Atlas Monitoring:** Track slow queries, resource usage, and set up alerts.
- **Lighthouse:** Use [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to audit performance and accessibility.
